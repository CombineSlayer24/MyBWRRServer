# MyBWRRServer
My Private Team Fortress 2 Dedicated server that I host from time to time. This Github contains some server stuff that can be viewed if curious of what robots are running in any custom missions, or playerable robots in general.

I will attempt to package every map, and icon that is needed to join the server. Instead of scouring through the Workshop, gamebanana, TF2maps, it would be a lot easier and faster to join the server.

# How to install the content?
I will either pack them in a VPK format, or a zip format. If I decide to go with one or another.

## .VPK — drag the .VPK file into Team Fortress 2\tf\custom

## .ZIP — place "maps" & "materials" from that .ZIP into Team Fortress 2\tf\
